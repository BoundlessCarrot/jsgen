# Cool Sh*t I've Found

I do a lot of browsing, on all corners of the internet. I've come across a lot of stuff, I figure this is a great place to keep the cool things. Eventually I'll also add my notes. 

Also, as much as I dislike those weird "e/acc" dorks on twitter, there's a lot of overlap with what they post as they do post a lot of good stuff. Such is life :)
